Tiled Dynamic
=============

An experiment in creating a TMX-based 2D 'game' that also utilises box2d physics and dynamic lighting.

Uses the following libraries:

* libGDX -- (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
* box2dlights -- (https://code.google.com/p/box2dlights/)
* Universal Tween Engine (included; not really used yet) -- (https://code.google.com/p/box2dlights/)

Graphical assets:

* Mack's tileset from (https://vxresource.wordpress.com/category/resources/tilesets/)
